As a global talent accelerator, they provide free IT training to skilled youth in regions of great need. They offer an employment pathway into the digital sector, accompanying young talents from recruitment to employment. In accordance with this, the background, project portfolio, performance and development of every Batch 2 trainee should be documented and presented in a Digital Profile for AmaliTech stakeholders to holistically evaluate their successful completion of training and suitable roles in the service center.
